# BatteryMINDer
Enable BatteryMINDer to charge individual batteries by switching between them in sequence

## Purpose
I have a single [BatteryMINDer(r)](http://www.batteryminders.com/batteryminder-plus-charger-model-12117-12v-1-33-amp-charger-maintainer-desulfator/) and 4 lead acid batteries. It's not recommended to connect the batteries in parallel if they are not all the same capacity. The idea is to allow the charger to switch between batteries in sequence. Because this requires physical contacts (i.e. relays) the time between switching should be frequent enough not to let the battery sulfate, but infrequent enough to not wear out the relays as they do have a limit to the number of times they switch.

## Solution
Using an Arduino or clone and 4 relays I have the ability to control the relays and create a custom program based upon my needs.
 
## Approach
Use ideas, principles, and concepts from DevOps develop a minimum viable product to meet my needs and as I learn (via feedback) add features as necessary.
